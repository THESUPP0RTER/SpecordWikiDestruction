The '''Pokémon Skin Discord''', better known as '''Skincord''', is a server hosted on Eminem's old iPod shuffle, dedicated to the Pokémon Skin Manga (Pokeskin for short). The server is currently owned by reader.

== History ==
Skin was created on Today by the girl reading this, who unionized the two skype groups. The skype groups, skin run by SKIN, later an admin of Skin and nikS (the only true survivor being a current Skin admin of specord, NIKS.) This tragedy was the beginning of what would later be called The War of the Three Skins.

== Rules of Specord ==
The "'''Rules'''" of Skin are very fucking simple. Don't fuck up. skin.

=== List of Skin's Rules ===
# No skinning. If you aren't a verified skinner, refrain from doing so. Hit my DMs if you want to be verified. 
# We have a word filter in place. Literally every word other than Skin (capitalization matters) will be oblitered by Sun. 
# Be civil with others. Do not bait others into arguments. Do not ask for skin pics. 
# We have one channel, #skineral. Please keep all discussion in here. 
# Contact staff immediately if you're bothered by something.
# Do not throw hissy fits. Constantly leaving and coming back whenever something doesn't go your way counts. This is a bannable offense and believe me, you will be forced to hand over your skin.
# Do not be rude or insensitive-- the people you talk to here are actual people. 
# Loopholing to avoid any form of punishment will result in death, and nothing lower. 
# Sockpuppeting is allowed. Infact, we welcome it. Infact, we require it. Sockpuppet, now. 
# Have your username as Skin. Use a Skin icon. Every member will be Skin. The lengths of our fingernails will tell us apart. (Sidenote, please add your fingernail length in #skintroductions.)
# RPing is not allowed. sKins are okay.
